# Text Generation with Linguistic Features using Transformer Model

## Overview

This code implements a text generation model based on the Transformer architecture. The model is trained to generate text sequences with linguistic features, including Part-of-Speech (POS) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tags. The training process involves Masked Language Modeling (MLM) loss and a reward-based loss calculated using BLEU score. The code includes a BPE Vocabulary class, a custom dataset class, and a modified Transformer model to incorporate linguistic features.

## Code Structure

1. **Importing Libraries:**
   - PyTorch and related libraries are imported, along with NLTK, SpaCy, and other necessary modules.

2. **BPE Vocabulary (BPEVocabulary):**
   - Implementation of a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Vocabulary class.
   - The vocabulary is built based on word frequencies and BPE merges.

3. **Text Generation Dataset (TextGenerationDatasetWithPOSandNER):**
   - Dataset class for text generation with POS and NER tags.
   - Utilizes NLTK for tokenization, POS tagging, and SpaCy for NER tagging.
   - Augmentation of sentences with synonym replacement, insertion, deletion, and swapping.

4. **Transformer Text Generation Model (TransformerTextGeneratorWithLinguisticFeatures):**
   - A modified Transformer model for text generation with linguistic features.
   - Embedding layers for words, POS tags, and NER tags.
   - Multihead attention layers for input sequence, POS tags, and NER tags.
   - Transformer decoder for generating sequences.

5. **Training Setup:**
   - Training loop with MLM loss and reward-based loss.
   - Gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients.
   - Learning rate scheduling.

6. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - CrossEntropyLoss for MLM loss.
   - BLEU score calculation for reward-based loss.

7. **Model Training and Validation:**
   - Training loop over epochs with MLM loss and reward-based loss.
   - Gradient clipping and optimization using Adam.
   - Learning rate scheduling.
   - Validation loop for evaluating the model.

8. **Model and Vocabulary Saving:**
   - Saving the trained model parameters and vocabulary to files.

9. **Text Generation Function (generate_text_with_linguistic_features):**
   - Function for generating text using the trained model with provided input sequence, POS tags, and NER tags.
   - Softmax sampling based on the model's output probabilities.

10. **Gradient Accumulation:**
   - Used gradient accumulation to update the model's parameters after accumulating gradients over multiple batches. This can stabilize training, especially with large batch sizes.

10. **Example Usage:**
    - Demonstrates how to train the model, save parameters and vocabulary, and generate text with linguistic features.

## Usage

1. **Initializing BPE Vocabulary:**
   ```python
   vocab = BPEVocabulary(100)
   vocab.build_vocabulary([text_corpus])
   ```

2. **Creating Text Generation Dataset:**
   ```python
   text_gen_dataset = TextGenerationDatasetWithPOSandNER([text_corpus], vocab, SEQ_LENGTH)
   ```

3. **Initializing Transformer Text Generation Model:**
   ```python
   params = {'vocab_size': len(vocab), 'embed_size': 512, 'num_heads': 8, 'num_layers': 3, 'dropout': 0.1, 'max_seq_length': 5000}
   text_gen_model = TransformerTextGeneratorWithLinguisticFeatures(**params)
   ```

4. **Training the Model:**
   ```python
   mlm_loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(ignore_index=vocab.stoi['<PAD>'])
   optimizer = optim.Adam(text_gen_model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
   scheduler = lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size=3, gamma=0.5)

   for epoch in range(NUM_EPOCHS):
       # Training loop
       # ...

       # Validation loop
       # ...

       # Save the model and vocabulary
       torch.save(text_gen_model.state_dict(), 'text_gen_model.pth')
       with open('vocab.pkl', 'wb') as f:
           pickle.dump(vocab, f)
   ```

5. **Generating Text with Linguistic Features:**
   ```python
   start_seq = "Who is Dasharatha?"
   pos_tags = ["WP", "VBZ", "NNP", "NNP"]
   ner_tags = ["O", "O", "PERSON", "PERSON"]

   generated_text = generate_text_with_linguistic_features(text_gen_model, start_seq, vocab, p=0.95, pos_tags=pos_tags, ner_tags=ner_tags)
   print(generated_text)
   ```

## Considerations and Customization

- The code can be customized for different hyperparameters, model architectures, and training strategies.
- The BPEVocabulary class can be adjusted for different frequency thresholds and BPE merge strategies.
- The transformer model architecture can be modified based on specific requirements.
- The augmentation strategy in the dataset class can be customized or extended.

## Dependencies

- PyTorch (v1.8.1)
- NLTK (v3.6.2)
- SpaCy (v3.0.6)
- NumPy (v1.20.3)

## Conclusion

This code provides a comprehensive implementation for training a text generation model with linguistic features using the Transformer architecture. It includes a BPE vocabulary, dataset class, training loop, and evaluation metrics. Users are encouraged to customize the code based on specific requirements and experiment with different configurations.
